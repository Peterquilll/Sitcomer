Martin agrees to go along with this, so long as Frasier promises to help arrange for wider parking spaces in the garage.  Martin is elected and becomes an immensely popular president, but soon grows tired of Frasier calling all the shots.  After Frasier doesn\'t immediately make good on his promise for the wider spaces, Martin backs out of the deal, as he believes that he can run the board on his own.  He soon finds that he is in over his head, as residents become annoyed with the complications created by the new spaces.  Frasier covers for him, so Martin publicly gives him credit for his ideas.  The board members turn on Frasier and accuse him of using his father, prompting an angry Martin to quit as a show of support for Frasier.

Jen remembers Roz as a fun and energetic person, so Roz has to go out partying with her every night so that her cousin will not think she has become boring.  However, their outings quickly leave Roz worn out and longing for sleep.  After Jen sets off Frasier by putting down Sigmund Freud, Roz sends her off with Kenny while she tries to calm Frasier.  Kenny and Jen, surprisingly, take a liking to one another.  Kenny admits that he longs to escape from his humdrum life and see the world.  He expresses an interest in joining Jen on her planned trip to Vietnam, but she says that she always travels alone.  A weary Roz tells Jen to stop trying to goad her into acting like she is still twenty.  She goes off on a tirade to a caller who doesn\'t want to commit to his girlfriend, and states that there is nothing wrong with acting one\'s age.  Her words about commitment and maturity stir Kenny, who decides that he is satisfied with his life.  He finally unpacks his boxes.

Roz mocks him upon learning that there is only a one in 10,000 chance of this.  However, Niles worries even more after experiencing a series of astonishingly improbable events--such as having his car struck by lightning, and twice winning a contest from a bottled water company for which there is only one winner in 10,000.  He goes to see a doctor, who confirms his worst fears by telling him that he must be hospitalized immediately due to an irregularity in his EKG.  Meanwhile, Frasier has difficulty finding a suitable housekeeper to replace Daphne.  Martin is impressed by a young woman who is a sports fan; and insists on hiring her, in spite of Frasier\'s objections.

Martin tries to act as though everything is fine so that he doesn\'t have to deal with the fear and uncertainty of the situation.  Roz tries to help the terrified Daphne stay calm.  She refuses to think of other things, stating that she has no future until she knows that Niles is all right.  Niles\' drug-induced comment about the possibility of hospitals having \"memories\" about their patients prompts everyone to think back on past experiences in that hospital, from Niles\' birth to a time that Roz mistook lipstick on Alice\'s cheek for a rash.  Daphne grows more and more tense as they await word on the surgery.

Frasier refuses to argue with Niles because he promised God that he would never quarrel with his brother again if he recovered from his sickness.  The frustration of having to agree with everything Niles says begins to drive Frasier crazy, especially when Niles starts monopolizing his radio show to give his own advice to callers.  Frasier believes he has found a way to back out of his promise after he learns that Daphne had already made her own deal with God.

He and Frasier enjoy all of the amenities, but are disturbed to learn that the spa has a \"gold level\" area to which they are denied access.  They constantly complain about being left out.  Roz believes that they only care about the gold level because they are not allowed there, but uses her connections to a senator who has a membership to get them inside.  The brothers are appeased, until they spot a platinum door.  They ignore an attendant\'s warning and barge through the door, but aren\'t too happy with the result.

She says that creating another person as wonderful as Frederick would be the best possible legacy they could leave.  Frasier agrees to do it, much to the surprise of his family.  When Frasier and Lilith argue at the clinic, he begins to fear that their second-born could inherit all of their worst qualities.  He believes that they are trying too hard to re-create the past.

Alice writes her name in crayon on the painting.  Daphne remains calm, and gives Roz the name of a man whom Niles uses to restore artwork.  However, the game hens catch fire in the meantime.  The caterers are too busy to replace them, so Daphne must turn to Frasier for help.  He comes over to assist with the food preparation, but must hide in the pantry whenever Niles comes in the kitchen so that his role will remain a secret.  Frasier becomes angry when he overhears Niles and others complimenting the food and saying how much better off they are without Frasier\'s involvement.  Mike Shaw, the artist responsible for the painting, shows for the party after earlier declining his invitation.  He doesn\'t care for the stuffy guests, and decides to go upstairs and watch pay-per-view boxing with Mrs. Moon.  Niles hears a couple\'s description of Shaw (white-haired man in a flannel shirt using a cane) and assumes they have him confused with Martin.  The couple who met Shaw has to leave.  Martin arrives to bring Frasier some dishes, and winds up having to pose as Shaw for the other guests.  Roz asks Daphne to stall the unveiling because the art restorer is painfully slow.  Niles insists that dinner must be served immediately.  He discovers Frasier, and they begin to argue, leading to more chaos.

Frasier assumes that the tournament\'s conclusion means the end of his relationship with Chelsea, but they soon begin dating.  Niles is surprised that Frasier would date a P.E. teacher after all of the abuse the brothers endured in gym class as children.  When Frasier goes to Chelsea\'s school to pick her up, he sees her berating one of the students.  This causes him to have flashbacks, and he can no longer look at Chelsea without seeing his old gym teacher, Coach Fuller.  Frasier tries to convince Chelsea to be more sensitive to the children.

Kenny remains depressed, so Martin lets him tag along to McGinty\'s.  They have a good time drinking and hanging out.  Kenny decides to follow Martin\'s advice and start getting out of the house so that he can take his mind off his problems.  He tells Frasier that he doesn\'t want to come in to see him anymore.

Roz tries to convince him that they should be allowed to furnish and decorate the house in whatever way they see fit.  Martin and Eddie give a presentation about safety to an elementary school class.  They are a big hit, and the school asks them to return for an assembly.

Ben\'s song intro (about doing the right thing) inspires Frasier to confront Avery.  Much to his surprise, Julia is hiding in the closet.  She had known all along that Avery was married.  A disgusted Frasier declares that he will stop trying to be a friend to her.  Julia seems saddened when Avery takes a call from his wife.  She realizes that Frasier was trying to help her, and shows her appreciation by getting Ben a job at a bank so that he can no longer perform at Nervosa.

Niles ends up having to pile lie upon lie to keep the news from Daphne, and even has to throw her a baby shower at the last minute after she suspects that is the reason for his odd behavior and nervousness.  Maris\'s lover, Esteban, shows up at the shower in search of Niles.  He mistakenly punches out Frasier as he tries to retaliate for Niles\' advice.  Daphne is furious to learn that Niles lied to her, and storms out.  She later returns, and Niles promises that Maris will never come between them again.  Just then, a radio report announces that Maris has been arrested for Esteban\'s murder.  Meanwhile, Frasier reconsiders his decision to return to private practice after his first two days are marred by a series of disastrous (and short) sessions.'),(248,11,8,'Murder Most Maris (2)','/iiPSoeVDWdOUhtlEcb08uVhwoSh.jpg','70207243','Niles is questioned by the police because he loaned Maris the murder weapon--an antique crossbow--for use in a play.  Maris insists that she acted in self-defense.  She continually calls Niles from jail, leaving Daphne extremely angry.  The media scrutiny surrounding the Cranes intensifies after Frasier--the self-appointed family spokesman--accidentally says that Niles and Maris will be \"executed\" rather than \"exonerated.\"  Niles and Daphne have to come stay with Frasier, and Daphne makes Niles sleep on the couch.  Frasier worries that Niles is reacting too calmly, as he believes that the anxiety will build up and eventually lead to a breakdown.  Overcome with stress and sleep deprivation, Niles winds up stripping off all his clothes in Cafe Nervosa.  Roz and Frasier manage to handle the situation.  Niles finally begins to display some anger about his predicament, and asks Maris to back off and stop calling him so often.'),(249,11,9,'Guns N\' Neuroses','/i4sScZ4xQy63nYvzYj9uNUDO6dS.jpg','70207244','Lilith comes to town for a one-day conference.

The woman then meets Frasier and arranges a blind date between an unwitting Frasier and Lilith.  Frasier and Lilith plan to meet for drinks at her hotel before their date(s).  When it takes longer than expected, Frasier calls the woman who arranged the date and says that he has to cancel.  Lilith tries to save face by cancelling the date herself.  She and Frasier each believe they have been stood up, but are hesitant to admit it to each other.  They have a wonderful evening together, and even help the couple in the next room deal with relationship problems.  Frasier winds up falling asleep and staying overnight.  Meanwhile, a frantic Niles, Martin and Daphne try to undo the damage after Martin\'s gun accidentally discharges in Frasier\'s apartment.'),(250,11,10,'Seabee Jeebies','/2egzE5TOIPUbDdFmYFW7KlKApqd.jpg','70207245','Niles gains notoriety throughout Seattle because of his involvement in Maris\'s murder case.  He and Daphne mingle with the city\'s social elite (including Bill Gates), and he is able to finagle reservations at booked restaurants.  Frasier grows very jealous, but hopes that his two Sea Bee nominations (which break the record for most nominations in a career) will help him return to the spotlight.  Kenny arranges for an interview, and Frasier invites the reporter to the ceremony.  However, everything quickly begins to go wrong.  Frasier loses his date because the event has to be scheduled for the morning due to Kenny\'s gaffe.  He then loses both of the awards, and the attention of the reporter, who is much more interested in Niles.  Roz, on the other hand, experiences the thrill of a lifetime when her judgmental sister--who has a seemingly perfect life--finally gets knocked off her pedestal.'),(251,11,11,'High Holidays','/eF1VkTFoyDVoDn8E52HhaPcugdn.jpg','70207246','Frasier is shocked when Frederick comes to visit sporting his new \"goth\" look.

Tensions rise among the staffers, who become extremely cranky due to hunger as the contest proceeds.  Noel starves himself and repeatedly faints after Roz suggests that he might get lucky with her in Vegas if they win the trip.  Frasier refuses to get into the competitive spirit until he discovers that their opponent\'s general manager is a man who bullied him in high school (stealing his chess set).  Meanwhile, Niles and Martin try to nurse an injured pigeon back to health; and Niles repeatedly suffers injuries of his own because the pregnant Daphne rolls over onto him in her sleep.'),(253,11,13,'The Ann Who Came To Dinner','/f1dYR5398UL0Ysz25ZgNACWnluR.jpg','70207248','Frasier discovers that his home insurance policy has been cancelled because Martin forgot to mail the payment several months earlier.

He mistakenly believes that Martin is inviting him along on his weekend in the mountains with Ronee, failing to realize that Martin was actually talking to Eddie.  Niles and Daphne also come along after Niles overhears a sarcastic remark by Ronee and mistinterprets it as an invitation.  Frasier is plagued by anxieties and cannot sleep during the trip.  He first dreams that he has killed Niles and married Daphne.  Niles mocks him for having such a simple dream, which he says is clearly a sign that he envies his brother\'s life.  Frasier also has a nightmare about his problems with the show.  Niles dreams about being a bad father, while Daphne suffers a nightmare in which she continually gains weight and Niles fools around with other women.  Martin also has an unusual dream in which he chides his family members for letting their worries overcome them, before bursting into a song and dance number about his positive attitude.

He plans to don a clown costume and full make-up as part of her treatment.  Martin sneaks into Frasier\'s office and scares him by coming up behind him with one of Frasier\'s masks over his face.  Frasier does not find this amusing, so Martin repeatedly teases him about being a \"fuddy-duddy.\"  Frasier decides to retaliate for the prank.  He tells Martin that he is leaving the apartment, then puts on the clown costume and rings the doorbell.  When Martin comes out to answer it, Frasier jumps out, wielding a cleaver.  Martin collapses and suffers a mild heart attack.  Frasier feels incredibly guilty about his actions, and is humiliated in the waiting room when the nurse reads off an account of what happened.

He explains the series of events that led up to this.  When Frasier was overcome by a coughing fit, Roz took over the show and advised a caller to seek counseling to deal with kleptomania, which she described as being the result of someone needing the thrill of stealing to deal with the emptiness in his or her life.  Frasier congratulated her on knowing what to say, but Roz said that it was easy because he is so predictable.'),(258,11,18,'Match Game','/nZVhRddAYobsiKM4nSN5GlCDClX.jpg','70207253','Frasier hires a professional matchmaker, but winds up going on a series of increasingly disasterous dates.

Bebe tells Frasier that he has been offered the chance to replace a recently deceased San Francisco radio host.  Frasier declines because he is happy with his life in Seattle.  She believes he is just playing hardball, and later approaches him again with an offer of a higher salary and the bonus of a regular morning television gig.  Frasier accidentally misses part of his show after engaging in a \"matinee\" with Charlotte.  Kenny fills in for him, and enjoys being on the air so much that he decides to quit his job and go back to being a disc jockey.'),(264,11,24,'Goodnight, Seattle (2)','/d21UP6R7ZSMs2W2inNRRR6fddww.jpg','70207259','Daphne gives birth to a healthy son, David.

Finding space coordinates in Shiro\'s artificial arm, the Paladins find Ulaz, who reveals he is part of an order known as the Blade of Marmora who are hidden within many ranks of Zarkon\'s Empire. Praxas, who is remade into a Ro-Beast, finds the Paladins and quickly gains the upperhand, until Ulaz sacrifices himself to destroy the monster and let Voltron find the HQ of the Blade of Marmora.

As Voltron engages the super-weapon, it learns and adapts to their attacks, even replicating them. After Pidge has help from the Olkari, she reconnects to her Green Lion in a way that allows her to summon a new weapon, which when the Black Cubes attempt to clone, instead grow massive plant roots.

Zarkon\'s ship discovers them again and another battle and jump leaves them without anymore crystal lenses needed for another wormhole. When hiding in a cosmic storm cloud, Allura comes to some realization that Zarkon is following them by tracking her energies. In engineering, Coran details what type of lenses they need, then Pidge remembers Hunk\'s cookies are exactly what they need.

When Keith &amp; Allura are informed by Coran they try to use the booster jets to arrive sooner but end up destroying their pod. Hunk activates a new power up for his Yellow Lion which prevents the Ark from falling into a lake of acid. The Red Lion ventures into space to Keith &amp; Allura\'s position and retrieves them to form Voltron, which defeats the Galra ship.

After Coran details his time in the swap meets as edgy and filled with space pirates, they arrive and find it to resemble an average mall on Earth. Varkon, a bumbling mall rent-a-cop, sees the four Paladins drop their terrible disguises and pursues them through the mall. Keith goes to a knife salesman for information on the blade he has, but learns it is from an extinct people before the salesman tries to steal it from him. Hunk is made to work off a tab for Sal, the owner of Vrepit Sal\'s diner, and earns a mass customer following with his gourmet skills. Varkon finds Hunk and he races out. Pidge and Lance find a shop which sells Earth material from the 1980\'s. Hunk meets up with Keith, then Pidge with Lance (after they bought everything in the store) and finally meet up with Coran who has the lenses.\n\nMeanwhile, the Black Lion reveals how it was created, and how Zarkon &amp; Alfor were once friends. Zarkon then connects to Shiro on the psychic plane where the difference in power is vast, but Shiro\'s words of trusting his Lion earn its protection and defeat of Zarkon in the psychic plane. Waking up, Zarkon loses more connection to the Black Lion and Shiro is now more connected to the Black Lion.

But Keith\'s possession of one of their blades causes immediate friction with the Trials of Marmora to resolve them one of two results: knowledge or death. Keith must fight to unlock about his past, and with each fight exhausts himself more and more. When entering a vision of his old home with his father, the outside of the house shows a Galra invasion, giving Keith a choice: stay and learn, or leave and rescue. The Red Lion attacks the base sensing Keith\'s endangerment, and upon deciding to end this mistrust and gain their alliance, Keith relents his dagger, only for it to awaken its true form of a saber upon his enlightened decision and revealing a truth: Keith has part Galra ancestry. Meanwhile, Commander Thace (the Marmora spy who shutdown the Solar Shield) alerts the Order that the investigation is increasing and the timetable must escalate to now!'),(20,2,9,'The Belly of the Weblum','/tkABo3Kd1NVmp61z8GMimIT9pGS.jpg','80075865','The Paladins split up to gather resources for a showdown with Zarkon.

While there, the instructional Coran made is dated to when he was in university and is corroded. The duo successfully enter the Weblum, but are separated after the first stomach, leaving Keith in the second and Hunk in the Weblum\'s bloodstream. In the second stomach, Keith finds a trapped a silent Galra pilot who helps him journey through the third stomach to reach the scaultrite. As the Weblum\'s defenses flare, the only way to make the scaultrite is for Hunk to threaten the beast enough outside to form the crystals. Upon the Weblum firing its beam, Keith packs more than enough scaultrite, but the Galran with him holds him up for a single full bag, and escapes. Keith thanks Hunk for his efforts, and Hunk pokes at Keiths newly learned Galra ancestry.'),(21,2,10,'Escape from Beta Traz','/tYxEnBlroMt1NxXNgqFFC4gOSt.jpg','80075866','By the information provided by the Blade of Marmora, Lance, Pidge and Shiro infiltrate a facility to free the only prisoner of the Galra Space Station Beta Traz. Upon successful infiltration, Pidge locates two cells instead of the one they were informed of. Pidge stays in the Main Command Center, but Lance and Shiro must reach and connect to the isolated Third level holding the two prisoners. Lance gains a 3D render of a Galra officer for the facial recognition. They each think they\'ve found the right inmate, but it gets harder to tell as Pidge goes radio silent when the station warden goes to the Command Center. Lance escorts his choice out, while Shiro deals with his being impossible because of his predicting statistical improbabilities of his death from the smallest thing. When Pidge is disabling the remaining security features, she finds footage of her brother Matt\'s escape. When the gravity is shut off, Shiro with Slav regroups with Lance, who learns he actually has the warden\'s personal pet Laika. In the hangar, everyone is regrouped but the Warden overpowers them until Slav opens the hangar doors to save the Paladins.

The creature, now merged with part of the encasing crystal it was once in, makes its way to the Castle as Allura goes skyward to protect the Balmera. Allura warps in the Paladins who regroup to their Lions to form Voltron. As they fight it, the team utilize their new weapons to subdue the Robeast and form Voltron to finally destroy the monster. Back on board the Castle, it is more apparent that since learning Keith\'s part Galra, Allura has a cold attitude to him. On the Olkarian home world, the super teludav is operational, and the team reminisce about their time since coming together. Meanwhile, Thace makes the error of returning for a spy device he planted, only for the Druids to intercept and capture him.'),(23,2,12,'Best Laid Plans','/rZoWNlhUc5A54utocreEjqDaze3.jpg','80075868','After acquiring the teludav from Olkari, the team prepares to launch the operation to defeat Zarkon and bring peace to the universe.

Keith plans to infiltrate the main ship of the Galra Fleet, but before leaving Allura stops him to explain that since waking up she views the Paladins as her new family and his being part Galra made her unsure. Following Thace\'s capture, the Druids interrogate him, and allow him to escape. Haggar helps Zarkon find the Black Lion, Zarkon\'s fleet arrives, Shiro distracts while Keith sneaks aboard. Despite that the battle is a trap, Zarkon is too engrossed in reclaiming the black Lion. Since the Druids rewrote the shield codes, their plan adapts to turn the core room into a bomb and cripple Zarkon\'s ship. When the Druids are sent after Thace while Zarkon has a rematch with Team Voltron. Thace sacrifices himself to cause the power core to overload and explode, just as the cloak teludav loses its cloak, and Zarkon\'s ship loses power.

As Zarkon himself goes to battle Voltron, Haggar &amp; her Druids go to protect their emperor as he readies his armor, which untested could kill him as well as Voltron. Before Zarkon can do anything, Haggar uses her dark magic to forcefully remove the Quintessence from Voltron, but is overloaded by the purity of Volton. While the Lions are unresponsive, their Paladins still live, but Zarkon arrives in a Ro-beast in his image. Allura uses whatever power she can to stall Zarkon to allow the Paladins to recover and battle Zarkon\'s Ro-beast. Allura, Kolivan and Antok go to battle Haggar to keep her from using her witchcraft from delaying Voltron. As their battles rage, Zarkon splits Voltron back to the individual Lions; Allura and Kolivan triumph in their fights, while Antok perishes at the hand of Haggar and another Druid. Shiro awakens to see his team being beaten, and the Bayard access port in his Black Lion activates, activating its Transcendent Wings to phase through Zarkon\'s Ro-Beast and reclaimg the original Black Bayard. As their fight continues, Haggar is revealed to be Altaean, and Allura learns she has the power to command Quintessence, which she uses to defeat Haggar and Kolivan avenges Antok.
